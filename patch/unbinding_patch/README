============================
= PARTICLE UNBINDING PATCH =
============================

The new routines are in the clump_finder.f90 file.

The main routine (unbinding) is called in the clump_finder routine
from the clump_finder.f90 after clump properties are written to file.

The purpose of this patch is to identify unbound particles in clumps
as identified by the clumpfinder and pass them on to the parent clumps,
until the halo-namegiver clumps are reached.


New namelist parameters for this pach:
(Can be set in the CLUMPFIND_PARAMS block)

NAME                        DEFAULT VALUE        FUNCTION
unbind=                     .true.               Turn particle unbinding on 
                                                 or off

nmassbins=                  50                   Number of bins for the mass 
                                                 binning of the cumulative
                                                 mass profile. Any integer >1.

logbins=                    .true.               use logarithmic binning 
                                                 distances for cumulative mass
                                                 profiles (and gravitational 
                                                 potential of clumps).
                                                 If false, the code  will use 
                                                 linear binning distances.

saddle_pot=                 .true.               Take neighbouring structures 
                                                 into account; Cut potentiall
                                                 off at closest saddle.

unbinding_formatted_output= .false.              Create formatted output for 
                                                 particles, cumulative mass
                                                 profiles, binning distances, 
                                                 particle based clump
                                                 properties, gravitational 
                                                 potential of substructure

iter_properties=            .true.               whether to unbind multiple times 
                                                 with updated clump properties
                                                 determined by earlier unbindings

conv_limit =                0.01                 convergence limit. If the

                                                 stop iterating for this clump. 
                                                 (only used when iter_properties=.true.)

repeat_max =                100                  maximal number of loops per level
                                                 for iterative unbinding
                                                 (in case a clump doesn't converge)
                                                 (shouldn't happen)
