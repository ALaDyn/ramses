## This is the [ramses](https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses) bitbucket repository.

Ramses is an open source code to model astrophysical systems, featuring self-gravitating, magnetised, compressible, radiative fluid flows. It is based  on the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)  technique on a  fully-threaded graded octree. 
[ramses](https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses) is written in  Fortran 90 and is making intensive use of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library.

You can go to the user's guide in [PDF here][4] and in the [WIKI here][1].

Check regularly the [automatic test page][2]. Visit the code web site [here][3].

Download the code by cloning the git repository using 
```
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses
```
This is the development branch. To get the last stable release do the following
```
$ git clone --branch stable_18_09 https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses
```

To generate idealised initial conditions of galaxies, check out the [DICE][5] code.

To generate cosmological initial conditions, check out the [MUSIC][6] code.

To visualize RAMSES data, we encourage you to use the [OSYRIS][7] or the [PYNBODY][8] codes.
