Ramses is an open source code to model astrophysical systems, featuring self-gravitating, magnetised, compressible, radiative fluid flows. It is based  on the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)  technique on a  fully-threaded graded octree. 
[ramses](https://github.com/ramses-organisation/ramses) is written in  Fortran 90 and is making intensive use of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library.
