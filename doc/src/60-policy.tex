The RAMSES code is freely available for non-commercial use under the
CeCILL License agreement. If a paper is published with simulations
performed with RAMSES, the authors should cite the following paper, in
which the RAMSES code was presented for the first time:

% TODO : Better citing 
{ \itshape
Teyssier, Romain, ``Cosmological hydrodynamics with Adaptive Mesh
Refinement: a new high-resolution code called RAMSES'', Astronomy and
Astrophysics, 2002, volume 385, page 337 }

If the same users need some basic help from the author on how to use
RAMSES, or if the simulations performed have needed from the code's
author some small adaptation of the code, a small sentence like ``We
thank Romain Teyssier for{\dots}'' in the Acknowledgment section will do
it.

If, on the other hand, the simulations performed requires the code's
author to be more deeply involved in the project (new developments, new
simulations from the author's side), then co-authorship of the paper is
asked.
